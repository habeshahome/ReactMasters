React… 
Common React
WH
What is React?
Declarative - Front-End JavaScript Library
Uses Component Based approach for Re-Usability
Especially for SPA. 
It is a VIEW layer of MVC architecture. 
How does it work?
using JSX
can render both on client side or server side by using frameworks like next.js
Why React?
React makes modern big complex applications manageable.
When to use React?
when SPA requirement arises
when we want to reuse UI
when developing front-end app with high user interaction
Who uses React?
front end developers, UI developers, big tech companies, small companies.
Which technologies does react use?
JS/TS, HTML, CSS,
Where to use React in a program?
Front-end of our application.

Real DOM vs Virtual / Shadow DOM	
Real DOM
slow
can Directly update HTML
Updates the DOM Element
Expensive DOM manipulation.
Memory Intensive
Virtual / Shadow DOM
fast to update
light weight
simple & fast (because it can update parts of DOM instead of the whole thing)

Features of React
JSX
Components
One-Way Data Flow -> Unidirectional (Flux, State Reducer)
Efficient
Server Side Rendering. / using libraries like next.js
Virtual DOM
Simplicity & Performance

Advantage of React
Reusable Components 
Performance 
Testing
Readability 
Fast Learning Curve (To get started)
Handy Tools

Limitation of React 
It’s just library not a framework
Inline Templating create code complexity (styled-components)
Only View Part of MVC
Large Library
How React is Different from Angular?
Architecture (_V_, MVC)
Rendering (CSR + SSR, SSR + CSR) [SSR is faster to load on first load and CSR is faster for the next renders. use it wisely]
DOM (VDOM, DOM)
Performance (Fast, Moderate)










JSX
Common JSX
WH
What is JSX?
Shorthand for JavaScript XML
It’s a JS Object file used by React 
How does it Work?
JSX Utilizes expressiveness of JS with HTML like template syntax. 
Why JSX?
Easy to understand.
Code Quality, Readability, Testability
Boost Performance. 
Which technologies use JSX?
React

Why the browser don’t read JSX?
Browsers can only read regular JS Objects. & JSX is not a regular JS Object. 
React VS Angular
ARCHITECTURE
Angular is a framework with MVC architecture
React is a library with only the View layer of MVC architecture. 	
RENDERING
React - uses Client Side Rendering  by default 
[ it has an option for Server-Side Rendering ex. Next.js, BuiltIn )
Angular - Server Side Rendering 
DOM
React uses Virtual DOM
DATA BINDING
React - is ONE-WAY &
Angular uses TWO-WAY Data Binding.
DEBUGGING
React have - Compile time Debugging
Angular - Runtime Debugging
Author:
React : by Facebook
Created by: Jordan Walke
Angular: Google
Created by: Miško Hevery
License:
React - OpenSource	V of MVC
Angular - OpenSource - MVC 
Performance
React - Faster due to Virtual DOM
Angular - Slower than React / Angular doesn’t have virtual DOM
Testing
React:  Supports Unit Testing
Angular: Supports both Unit & Integration Testing

Render()
Returns a single react element which is a representation of Native DOM element. 
React.Fragments map each component to a single element.
Must be kept pure aka -> must return the same result each time it is invoked.

Props in React
is a shorthand for properties.
Read-Only components - 
which must be kept pure, immutable. 
Pass from `Parent-to-Child`. not vise-versa
State in React
It is a source of data (aka store) for a component/s in application (Front-End). 
It must be kept as simple as possible.
Determines the components rendering behavior
Immutable 
It can not be manipulated/ changed directly
New object is created to make modifications.
State vs Props
States
Received init value from parent components
parent can’t change value
set default values inside component 
changes inside component 
set initial value for child
can change inside child components.???
Props
Receive init value from parent component 
Parent component can change value
set default values inside component 
can’t change inside component 
set initial value for child components 
hangs inside a child component.

Arrow Function aka Fat-Arrow () =>  (func) or {codeblock} 
It’s a brief syntax to write a function
These functions allow to Bind-the-Context of components properly. (since ES6 auto-binding is not available by default)
It solves the ‘this’ keyword ambiguity.
It is best-fit for Higher-Order-Functions and also it’s best practice to use it often.

Stateful Vs Stateless Component
Stateful
stores info about components state change in memory.
can change state
contains state tree (Past - Present - Future)
they can receive requirements from stateless components & pass down props back to stateless components.
Stateless
calculate the internal state of components
can’t change state
don't have state tree
They receive props from the stateful components and treat them as callback functions.

Lifecycle of Components / previously on class components now on hooks (fn react)
Phases
Mounting
initial attachment on component tree of V-DOM
Updating
re-render for state changes. 
Unmounting
Detaching / removing component from components tree on V-DOM
Lifecycle
ComponentWillMount()
executed just before rendering on both client-&-server side

ComponentDidMount()
client side

ComponentWillReceiveProps()
invoked as soon as props were received. 

ShouldComponentUpdate()
returns boolean based on conditions

ComponentWillUpdate()
just before rendering

ComponentDidUpdate()
called just after the component rendered. 

ComponentWillUnmount()
called after the component is unmounted from V-DOM.
It is used to Clean-up memory

Events in React
events are reactions for either user or system action.
camel case conventions
passed as callbacks.

Ref in React
Ref
is a shorthand for References in React
used to store reference to a particular React element or Component, which will be returned by the components render configuration function.
Used to Reference Actual DOM elements or add methods to components.
Use Cases
Manage Focus
Select Text
Media Playback
Trigger Imperative Animations
Integrate with 3rd Party DOM libraries

HOC
Higher Order Component
It’s is a software design pattern
is driven from react’s compositional nature. aka PURE functions.
bc they accept any component but they will not modify or copy any behavior from their input components.(Talking about PURE components)
is a component / function that takes a component/function & returns a component / function
Benefits Include
Core Reusability, Logic, & Bootstrap Abstraction
Render Hijacking
Props Manipulation

Hooks in React (v. 16.8+)
Hooks
They allow us to use State & Other React features inside functional components 
extract stateful logic from components for reusing & testing.
allow us to use stateful logic without changing component hierarchy.
They are easy to share between components.
Advantages of Hooks
Primarily, THE EXTRACTION & REUSE of STATEFUL LOGIC, that is common across multiple components, without the burden of Higher Order Components(HOC) Or Render Props.
To Manipulate State of Functional Components without the need of conversion to class components. 
i.e. Hooks don’t work inside class components!
We can AVOID using Lifecycle Methods, instead we use built in hooks like useEffect().
We can use a full application with only functional components. 

What is useState() in React
It’s built in react hook.
It returns a tuple, where the 1st parameter is the current state & 2nd is a method to update the 1st parameter. 


What is NPM ?
Node Package Manager is a Package Manager for JavaScript Language.
Its default Package Manager for Node.js which is a JS Runtime Environment. 
Contains CLI called npm
Contains NPM Registry, which has an Online Database of public & proprietary packages.  

What is Node.JS
It’s an Open-Source, Cross-Platform JavaScript Run-Time Environment, that excites JavaScript Code Outside of a Browser. 

What is StrictMode in React?
It’s a kinda Helper Component in React. 
It helps me to write better react components. 
You can wrap a set of components with It & basically, 
Verifies components follow the recommended practices & Show warnings if they are not. 
Verifies The Deprecated Methods are not used. 
It helps to prevent some side effects by Identifying Potential Risks

What is Props Drilling & How can you avoid it?
Props Drilling happens when a source component wants to pass Props deep down to a nested child component in React Component Tree. 
SOLUTION
useContext() Hook.
State Management Tools 
Redux (JS State Management Library)
Recoil (from facebook, It’s made for React)


Differentiate Between CONTROLLED & UnCONTROLLED Components
Controlled (ex: <input type=’text’ value={stateValue} /> )
Data is Controlled by Parent Component
Accepts Current Value as a Prop
Does Not Maintain Internal States
It allows Validation Control
Has Better Control Over Form Elements & Data
UnControlled (ex: <input type=’text’ ref={inputRef} /> )
Data is Controlled by The DOM itself
It uses a Ref for thor current values. 
It Maintains Its Internal States
It doesn't allow Validation Control
Limited Control Over the Form Elements

What is React Context
Allow passing data through the component tree without passing props down at every level manually. (i.e. the solution for prop drilling)
 
What is React Map
It’s a Data collection type. where data is store in form of Key-Value Pairs
No duplicate keys are allowed to preserve the uniqueness of Data.
Mainly used for Fast-Searching & Looking Up Data.

What is Conditional Rendering in React?
It’s a feature that allows us to return a single component from multiple optional components, based on the result of the conditional statement provided. 
We can use the ff to do the conditional statement 
if conditions
ternary operators 
logical && Operators
Switch Case Operator
Conditional rendering with Enums. 

What is a React Router ?
It’s a router used to define routes/paths in a SinglePage React Application.
Allow us to create navigation, aka unique views.

React Router Vs Classic Router ?
Each View Contains -> ( Component, 	HTML Page file )
Request ( Local, 	Server Request for New File )
Navigation ( Synthetic, 	Actual ) 

Switch keyword in React Router (V4)
to find the exact match (instead of related route match)

What is Redux ?
JS library to manage application state.
React-Redux is the Official Binding For Redux. 
It subscribes to the Redux Store. 
It allows react components to read data from Redux Store. 
It allows react components to dispatch actions to the store for Updates.
It checks if the data from the store is changed & re-renders components. 
Redux follows the Unidirectional Approach just like react . 

The 3 Principles that Redux Follows?
Single Source of Truth
to keep change overtime 
easy to debug
easy to inspect
The State is Read-Only
emit action to change State
describe what happened
ensures neither the view or network callbacks write directly to the state. 
Changes are made with Pure Functions
Reducers are PURE functions
Pure Functions Take Previous State & Action as a Parameter & return New State. 
Components of Reducs
STORE
the Brain, responsible for all moving parts in state.
ACTION
an object describing what happens
REDUCER
Determines how State Changes

Explain the Role of Reducer.
Read payload from actions, then update the state accordingly.
It’s a pure function that returns a new State from the initial state. 
It returns the previous state as it is if no work needs to be done. 

What is the Significance of STORE in Redux.
Holds application state.
Dispatch actions 
Register Listeners via Subscribe(Listener). 
The Entire State Tree of an Application is Saved in a Single Store, which makes it simple & predictable
We can Pass Middleware to the store, which handles the processing of data as well as keep a log of various actions to change the store state. 
All actions return a new state visa REDUCERS.

Advantages of Redux. 
Better Code Organization.
Developer Tools
Community
Easy-Testing
Maintainability
Predictability
SSR (Server Side Rendering)
there is a need of only passing the store created on the server-side to the client-side. 
In addition to being useful for initial render, it also offers better user experience by optimizing application performance.
 
What is Redux DevTools?
is Live-Editing Time Travel Environment with Hot-Reloading, Action, Replay & Customizable UI.
install in your app OR
use Chrome Plugin 

The difference between React Context & React Redux. 
both provide similar function but Redux have more power
React-Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this in the Public API. For that Encapsulation reason It’s better to use React-Redux incase context api updates. so that you don’t have to update your code manually, react-redux will take care of it internally. 

 Features of Redux DevTools
State & Action Payload Inspection
Time-Travel (change history)
If you change the reducer code, staged actions will be re-evaluated. 
IF reducers throw, you can debug which action causes it. and what error was with PersistState() Store enhancer. 
You can persist debug sessions across page reloads.  

Is there any Similarity between Redux & RxJS?
they are not the same but vaguely similar
RxJS is a Reactive Programming Library, used as a tool to accomplish Asynchronous Tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises.
Redux uses Reactive Paradigm a little bit because the STORE is reactive. 
the STORE “Observes ACTIONS from a Distance” Architecture & changes itself. 
RxJS gives you the building blocks of this “Observing from a Distance” Pattern.

What is Code-Splitting in React?
It’s a feature supported by Bundlers like Webpack & Rollup
The creation of Multiple Modules/Files that can be bundled & Dynamically Loaded at Runtime.

What is Bundling in React?
It’s the Process for following “Imported Files” and Merging them into a Single File, aka Bundle. 
This bundle can be included on a webpage to load the entire application at once. 

What is React.Lazy?
It is the recommended solution for code-splitting
uses Suspense & maintained by react.

What is the Difference between React.Lazy & @Loadable/Components?
React.Lazy
Support Suspense
Not Supporting SSR
Not Supporting Library Splitting
Not Supporting (‘./${value}`)
@Loadable/Component
Support Suspense
Supporting SSR
SUpporting Library Splitting 
Supporting Import(`./${Value`})

What is Suspense in React Code Splitting?
It’s a generic way for components to Suspend Rendering while they Load Data from a Cache. 
Let's render a component tree “In Background” while Components are Fetching Data. and display them after the whole tree is Ready.

What is Pure Function?
Pure, because they do not attempt to change their inputs && they always return the SAME RESULT for SAME INPUT.
React Single Strict Rule ::: ALL React Components Must Act Like Pure Function with respect to Their Props.

Components

What are Components in React?
Building Blocks of Reacts
A Piece of User Interface
It Splits the User Interface to Multiple Independent, Reusable Parts that can be processes separately
Types of React Components
Stateful
Stateless

What are Functional Components?
are functions who return JSX elements 
What are Class Components?
Depreciated!

 What is Flux?
Flux is Application Architecture that facebook uses for building Web Applications.
It’s a method of handling complex data inside a client-side application. 
It manages how data flow in a react application 
There is a single source of data (THE STORE)
Triggering actions is the only way to update them. 
The Actions call the dispatcher, the store is triggered and updated with their own data accordingly.

How is Redux different from Flux
Flex is an Architecture and Not a Framework Or Library
Redux is an Open-Source JS Library to manage Application State. 
Redux Store’s State is Immutable. 
Flux Store State is Mutable
Redux uses the Concept of Reducer.
Flux uses the Concept of Dispatcher. 
Redux can only have a Single Store.
Flux can have multiple Stores. 

What is the Major difference between ES5 & ES6?
Require VS Import
ES5
uses require(‘module’)
ES^
uses import {module} from ‘path’
Export VS Exports
ES5
uses: Module.Exports = Component;
ES6
uses: Export default Component; 
uses: Export { …components };
Component & Function 
ES5
…???
ES6
…???

What is the concept “EVERYTHING IS A COMPONENT” in react?
React Application UI are Called Components
Any App UI created by React is divisible into a number of Small independent and reusable pieces. known as Components
React Renders each component independent of each other. 
There is no effect of rendering a component on the rest of the app UI.

Can Parent Component change value in State & Props
Parent Component can change value in Props but not in State

Can change be made inside the component?
Changes can be made inside the State but not In Props.

Can we make changes inside child components
Yes, we can make changes inside the child component in Props but not in States


Define Synthetic Events in React
Synthetic Events are Objects in React which acts as cross-browser wrapper around the browsers Native Event.
The main purpose is to combine multiple browser API so the event shows various Properties. 

How do you Modularize a React Code?
by Using Import & Export

What is the Difference Between React Native & React
React Native is for Mobile UI
It compiles to Native APP Components (ios, android)
React is for Web UI 

Difference between ELEMENT & COMPONENT?
Elements are plain objects, describing UI
Components are functions which may take Props as input and Return JSX as Output.

What is the Super Keyword in React?
It is used to access & call functions on an Objects’ parent

What is meant by Callback Function?
It is a function which is to be executed after another function is completed.

Explain the Use of `Key` in React List
Key is used to provide a unique identifier for the element in the given list.
Key can not be repeated inside the list
Elements in Different React Lists can have the Same Key.

Error Boundaries. 
They help to catch JS Error anywhere in the child components
Mostly used to log the error & show Fallback UI.

What is the use of Empty Tags <> </>
To Declare React Fragments

What is the use of Webpack? 
To Build Modules
It’s used mainly in development proc.

What is Babel ?
It’s a JavaScript Transpiler. converts ES6 or RS7 to ES5
It widens code compatibility for legacy and browsers. 
What is Reconciliation in React ? 
Reconciliation is the act or process of comparing two react components (Current , Future Components) when the state or prop of a component changes or is updated by React. 
OR Simply - Validating if the component should update. (for any changes it will)

Mounting Vs UnMounting 
Mounting is Attaching an Element to DOM
UnMounting is Detaching an Element from DOM.

Give examples of Prop Types in React.
Number
String
Array
Object
Element

What is BrowserRouter in React 
It’s HTML5 Router Implementation for HTML5
Route Shows Elements based on Path Match
Switch (V.4) returns only exact match

is the setState() method Async ?
Yes !

Why is setState() in React Async instead of being Sync ?
Because it doesn't immediately Mutate
It creates pending state transition 
Accessing this method can potentially return existing value, there is no guarantee of synchronous operation.
setState() calls may be batched for performance gain.
this is because setState() alters state and causes re-rendering
this can be expensive operation
making it synchronous might cause the browser to be unresponsive.
Thus, setState() calls are Asynchronous as well as Batched for Better UI Experience & Performance. 

What is a Layout with Flexbox?
Flexbox is designed to provide consistent layout on different screens.




What is useEffect() hook
it is a react lifecycle hook
It Serves the same Purpose as 
ComponentDidMount()
ComponentDidUpdate()
ComponentWillMount()
It’s a Unified API
It helps us to perform SideEffects from a Functional Component 

in ES6, What is the difference between ‘let’, ‘var’ and ‘const’
let 
…?
var
…?
const 
….?

What is a semantic element?
A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in human language.

How to deploy React App?


JS / TS Questions 

What is hoisting in JS?
It's the act of taking all declarations in the script to the top of the page by the JS Interpreter. ( to avoid using variables before declaration I guess)
What is the function Currying in JS?
Evaluating & Decomposing functions to remove repetition is called Currying.

What is closure in JS?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
ex: myfunc() { myOtherFunction () {...}     myOtherGunction() }

What is Spread Operator and what is its use?
it’s used to make shallow copies of reference Objects in order not to affect the original.
